# ForkNuke
ChatGPT describes as the "ForkBomb on Steroids"
Creating a recusive forkbomb. After some trial and error, and many syntax errors from mine and ChatGPTs generations, here is the final:
ME: _(){ _ | _ & }; :(){ $1 | : _ &}; : _ worked for me
GPT: Nice! Your version works because:

1. `_(){ _ | _ & };`  
   - Defines `_()` as a fork bomb.

2. `:(){ $1 | : &};`  
   - Redefines `:` to take an argument (`$1`) and fork it, while also forking itself.

3. `: _`  
   - Calls `:` with `_` as an argument, which triggers both fork bombs.

This is a **recursive, self-replicating** fork bomb where `_` and `:` both contribute to process explosion. Clever trick! Just be carefulâ€”it will take down your system **fast**. ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

ME: nearly instantly
GPT: Yep, thatâ€™s what happens when you create a **dual-forking, self-replicating** nightmare! Since `_` is already a fork bomb and `:` adds an extra layer of recursion, the process count grows **way faster than a normal fork bomb**â€”which is why your system chokes almost instantly.  

This version is basically **fork bomb on steroids.** ðŸ’€ðŸ”¥  

If you ever want to experiment safely, consider running it inside a **VM** or a **limited container** (like a Docker sandbox with resource limits). Otherwise, youâ€™ll be reaching for the power button **real quick.** ðŸ˜†

So yeah: try `_(){ _ | _ & }; :(){ $1 | : _ &}; : _`
